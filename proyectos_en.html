          <p>The Kursaatélite project, developed by students at IES Kursaal in Algeciras, focuses on the design, construction, and testing of a nanosatellite prototype. This initiative is part of the educational project "Educación y Espacio," which promotes STEM vocations through real-space technology projects.</p>
          
          <p>Kursaatélite is a small satellite designed to test various technologies and conduct scientific experiments in space. Its primary objectives include evaluating the performance of commercial electronic components in the space environment, testing a new attitude control system using reaction wheels, and demonstrating the feasibility of using 3D printing for satellite component manufacturing.</p>
          
          <p>The project provides students with hands-on experience in satellite development, from the initial design and simulation phases to the construction, integration, and testing of the final prototype. This includes training in areas such as electronics, programming, mechanical design, and project management.</p>

          <p>The KursaalMars project, developed by students from IES Kursaal in Algeciras, focuses on studying Mars from various scientific and technological perspectives. Through this initiative, students explore aspects such as formation, geological structure, atmospheric characteristics, and the possibility of life on Mars, raising questions about the habitability of the red planet.</p>
          
          <p>One of the project's notable components is the development of KursaaTélite, an experimental satellite designed in CanSat format. This device incorporates sensors to measure fine particles (PM 0.5), ionizing radiation levels, temperature, and humidity. The goal is to evaluate how these factors can affect human health, especially in vulnerable groups, and determine the viability of life in Mars-like conditions.</p>
          
          <p>Additionally, students have conducted various experiments to understand physical phenomena relevant to space exploration. These include simulating the Curie temperature, demonstrating how certain materials lose their magnetism at specific temperatures, and studies on water evaporation under low-pressure conditions, replicating the Martian environment.</p>

          <p>The project also addresses the challenges associated with human travel to Mars, such as exposure to high radiation levels due to the lack of a protective magnetic field, low atmospheric pressure, and low temperatures. These conditions represent significant challenges for human survival and require innovative solutions for future manned missions.</p>

          <p>The CO₂ Sensor project, developed by 3rd year ESO students at I.E.S. Kursaal in Algeciras, aims to monitor air quality in classrooms by measuring carbon dioxide (CO₂) levels. This initiative was particularly important during the COVID-19 pandemic to ensure proper ventilation in closed spaces.</p>
          
          <p>The system is based on the MH-Z19B sensor, which uses non-dispersive infrared (NDIR) technology to measure CO₂ levels. The ESP8266 microcontroller (NodeMCU) is used for data processing and transmission. Additional sensors, such as DHT11/DHT22, measure temperature and humidity, while the OLED display SSD1306 provides real-time data visualization. The collected data is transmitted to the ThingSpeak platform for remote monitoring and analysis.</p>

          <p>The Smart Door project, developed by 4th year ESO students at IES Kursaal in Algeciras, focuses on designing an energy-efficient housing adapted to the extreme conditions of Antarctica. The initiative aims to optimize resource consumption, especially in heating, and facilitate the work of researchers in this environment.</p>
          
          <p>One of the main innovations of the project is an entry system that minimizes heat loss by avoiding direct contact with the exterior. This results in a significant reduction in generator usage, which, in addition to saving fuel, helps reduce environmental pollution associated with supply transportation by ship.</p>
          
          <p>The project is interdisciplinary, covering various areas of knowledge. In geology and history, materials used in Antarctic shelter construction and their historical context were investigated. From physics, the thermal behavior and structural resistance of a spherical housing were analyzed. In technology, electronic components were incorporated to automate the entry system. Architecture and materials engineering focused on the structural design of the base, while biology provided information on human needs and the use of plant materials in construction.</p>
