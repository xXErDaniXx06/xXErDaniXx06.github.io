          <p>The CO₂ Sensor project, developed by 3rd year ESO students at I.E.S. Kursaal in Algeciras, aims to monitor air quality in classrooms by measuring carbon dioxide (CO₂) levels. This initiative was particularly important during the COVID-19 pandemic to ensure proper ventilation in closed spaces.</p>
          
          <p>The system is based on the MH-Z19B sensor, which uses non-dispersive infrared (NDIR) technology to measure CO₂ levels. The ESP8266 microcontroller (NodeMCU) is used for data processing and transmission. Additional sensors, such as DHT11/DHT22, measure temperature and humidity, while the OLED display SSD1306 provides real-time data visualization. The collected data is transmitted to the ThingSpeak platform for remote monitoring and analysis.</p>

          <p>The Smart Door project, developed by 4th year ESO students at IES Kursaal in Algeciras, focuses on designing an energy-efficient housing adapted to the extreme conditions of Antarctica. The initiative aims to optimize resource consumption, especially in heating, and facilitate the work of researchers in this environment.</p>
          
          <p>One of the main innovations of the project is an entry system that minimizes heat loss by avoiding direct contact with the exterior. This results in a significant reduction in generator usage, which, in addition to saving fuel, helps reduce environmental pollution associated with supply transportation by ship.</p>
          
          <p>The project is interdisciplinary, covering various areas of knowledge. In geology and history, materials used in Antarctic shelter construction and their historical context were investigated. From physics, the thermal behavior and structural resistance of a spherical housing were analyzed. In technology, electronic components were incorporated to automate the entry system. Architecture and materials engineering focused on the structural design of the base, while biology provided information on human needs and the use of plant materials in construction.</p>

          <p>The Kursaatélite project, developed by students at IES Kursaal in Algeciras, focuses on the design, construction, and testing of a nanosatellite prototype. This initiative is part of the educational project "Educación y Espacio," which promotes STEM vocations through real-space technology projects.</p>
          
          <p>Kursaatélite is a small satellite designed to test various technologies and conduct scientific experiments in space. Its primary objectives include evaluating the performance of commercial electronic components in the space environment, testing a new attitude control system using reaction wheels, and demonstrating the feasibility of using 3D printing for satellite component manufacturing.</p>
          
          <p>The project provides students with hands-on experience in satellite development, from the initial design and simulation phases to the construction, integration, and testing of the final prototype. This includes training in areas such as electronics, programming, mechanical design, and project management.</p>

            <h3>My Future Projects as a Computer Engineer</h3>
            <img src="images/futuro.jpg" alt="Future projects in computer engineering" class="project-image">

        <div class="content">
          <p>As a Computer Engineering student with a deep technological vocation, my future projects are built on three fundamental pillars: practical innovation, social commitment, and technical excellence. My academic journey, reinforced by real projects and multidisciplinary skills, has forged in me a clear vision of the impact I wish to generate as a professional: developing technological solutions that positively transform people's lives and improve current systems, whether in financial, educational, environmental, or social fields.</p>

          <h4>Software Development with Real Impact</h4>
          <p>One of my main goals is to specialize in robust and scalable software development, focused on solving real problems. I have already worked on practical projects that combine efficient algorithms, solid data structures, and good design practices, from desktop applications to client-server architectures using technologies like Flask, Java, Docker, or Angular. In the future, I want to participate in developing products that not only work but are maintainable, accessible, and ethical.</p>

          <p>I am particularly interested in participating in open-source projects and collaborative platforms, where I can contribute from my knowledge in algorithmic structures and modular design to my growing experience in automated testing and object-oriented development with Java and Maven. I aspire to contribute to software that serves education, sustainability, or institutional transparency.</p>

          <h4>Artificial Intelligence and Data Analysis</h4>
          <p>After participating in challenges like the Crypto Trading Hackathon, I discovered a fascination with data analysis and building algorithmic strategies in uncertain environments. This interest has led me to deepen my use of tools like Python, pandas, scikit-learn, and NumPy, and to develop prediction models, portfolio optimization, and risk assessment.</p>

          <p>One of my medium-term projects is to design an intelligent investment analysis platform that uses machine learning models to help young investors make informed decisions, with an ethical and educational approach. In the long term, I wish to join teams working on AI applications applied to health, climate, or urban mobility.</p>

          <h4>Systems Engineering and Architecture</h4>
          <p>As someone passionate about low-level programming, another development line in my engineering profile is understanding and building efficient systems from the ground up, from assembly language to logic circuit simulation. I have worked with RISC-V, Logisim, and flow control structures, and I would like to apply this knowledge in designing embedded systems, microcontrollers, or IoT devices applied to intelligent environments (smart home, connected cities, environmental sensors...).</p>

          <h4>International Projection and Continuous Learning</h4>
          <p>My C1 level of English and communication skills allow me to interact in international environments, something I intend to reinforce by seeking internship opportunities, exchanges, or collaborations outside Spain. At the same time, I value continuous learning: I want to keep learning languages, paradigms, architectures, and agile methodologies that strengthen my professional profile.</p>

          <h4>Entrepreneurship and Young Leadership</h4>
          <p>Finally, one of my goals is to launch a technological entrepreneurship project before finishing my degree. I want to lead or co-lead a young team with vision, capable of building a startup where technology serves a clear purpose: energy efficiency, access to knowledge, digital inclusion... I seek not only to develop code but to lead ideas.</p>
